[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/farskipper/ecmaless.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/farskipper/ecmaless)
[![stability - experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange.svg)](https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index)

A compile to JS language where less is more, worse is better, and reliability is king.

* functional, but not pure
* statically typed (structural, strong, generic/algebraic, and inferred minus function declarations)
* single-file modules (like CommonJS)
* no inheritance (no `class` and no `prototype`)
* no exceptions (errors are values)
* minimal syntax (but not as minimal as lisp, it's more like lua)
* ships with a code formatter (so we don't waste time arguing about style)
* designed for humans who understand skill comes from experience not from tooling and fancy language features
